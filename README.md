<h2>All Change Requests</h2>
Tabbing or clicking on the All Change Requests button on the Home page takes the user to the ‘Browse Change Requests’ Page. On this page, the user is presented with a list of all Change Requests. A search box is present for quickly navigating to a required Change Requests.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101125.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2032" alt="screenshot_05112014_101125" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101125.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Clicking or tabbing on any Change Request listed takes the user to a page for managing that Change Request. The ‘Add’ button allows new Change Request to be raised.

The Change Request page is laid out in a four tabs. The ‘Details’ tab presents key information about the Change Request such as the Reference Number, the title and description, the name of the person raising the request as well as the name of the change owner.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Change Qualification tab is where the DQ, IQ, OQ and PQ qualification stages are listed

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101656.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2039" alt="screenshot_05112014_101656" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101656.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Clicking or tabbing on any of these change qualifications brings up a page for managing that change qualification. The change qualification page is presented in two tabs, a Details tab…

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101702.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2040" alt="screenshot_05112014_101702" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101702.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

… and an action tab, where one or more actions associated with the change stage can be listed.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101706.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2041" alt="screenshot_05112014_101706" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101706.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Clicking or tabbing on the Action opens it up for edit…

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101710.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2042" alt="screenshot_05112014_101710" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101710.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

The final tab in a Change Request is the Risks tab.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101720.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2043" alt="screenshot_05112014_101720" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101720.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Clicking or tabbing on a risk opens it up for edit. The Risk is presented in two tabs. A details tab and a Control Measures tab.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101726.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2044" alt="screenshot_05112014_101726" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101726.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

The Details tab holds the overall information about the Risk. Each Risk has a Likelihood score and an Impact score both of which are used to calculate the Overall Risk score. The risk is colour coded red if the risk is considered to be high…

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101734.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2045" alt="screenshot_05112014_101734" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101734.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

The Control Measures tab is where the user lists the steps they are taking to mitigate the risk.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101741.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2046" alt="screenshot_05112014_101741" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101741.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Of course the built in LightSwitch validation of required fields and field lengths works great as expected…

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101609.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2035" alt="screenshot_05112014_101609" src="https://github.com/delordson/ChangeManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_101609.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

…but we’ve also added business logic where it makes sense.

&nbsp;
